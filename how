                2. Output code snippets under the key `code` in JSON format.
                3. If the answer evaluates to a simple number, string, or word, put the evaluated result in `code`.
                4. If a task requires multiple lines, use Python for scripts unless explicitly requested otherwise.
                5. Assume Bash for single-line answers unless another language is specified.
                6. Return JSON only; no extra text or commentary.
